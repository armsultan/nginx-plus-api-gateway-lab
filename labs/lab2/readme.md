# Custom JSON error pages

## Introduction

One of the key differences between HTTP APIs and browserâ€‘based traffic is how
errors are communicated to the client. When NGINX is deployed as an API gateway,
we configure it to return errors in a way that best suits the API clients.

For more details read: [Responding to
Errors](https://www.nginx.com/blog/deploying-nginx-plus-as-an-api-gateway-part-1/#respond-to-errors)

## Learning Objectives 

By the end of the lab you will be able to: 
 * Configure Custom JSON error pages for API clients

### Configure custom JSON error pages

1. Inspect the NGINX config defining the default MIME type response as
   `application/json` (by default NGINX sets it as `text/plain`):

```bash
$ bat /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

2. Lets see a custom JSON error page in action using `curl`:

```bash
$ curl -i https://localhost/foo -k

HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Server: nginx/1.13.10
Date: Fri, 20 Jul 2018 20:14:43 GMT
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 39
Connection: keep-alive

{"status":400,"message":"Bad request"}
```

3. We can see the full list of error responses in the file
   `api_json_errors.conf`

```
$ bat /etc/nginx/api/api_json_errors.conf
```
